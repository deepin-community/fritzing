Description: Easy-to-use electronic design software
 Fritzing is an open source project designed to help one transition from a
 prototype to a finished project. Aimed at users who want to produce or document
 circuits and experiments, one starts by building a physical prototype, then
 recreating it with Fritzing’s graphical editor. From there one can generate a
 schematic, PCB artwork, and PCB production files.
